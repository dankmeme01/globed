# Globed

Globed is a multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

## Usage

In the main menu you should see an extra button at the bottom. It will open the Globed Menu, where you can press the gear button and set the URL of the Globed Central Server (due to technical limitations it was easier to put it here than in settings). After you connect to a valid Central Server, the mod will automatically fetch the individual Game Servers and show you the various information about them, such as player count, region, ping, and name. All you have to do is pick the server you want and press 'Join'. After that, simply hop into a level and you will see anyone who is also playing on the level.

## Settings

Currently, the only options available in traditional mod settings are Overlay position and Overlay location. By changing those you can change where on screen you will see the server latency, unless you disable it.

## Issues & PRs

If you find any issues or potential improvements to the mod or the server, feel free to make an issue or a pull request. If you are trying to report a fatal error, please make sure to include the logs.
