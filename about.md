# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

It is very much in beta, and will probably be buggy and laggy. Please be aware of that. If you can reproduce a crash then please report it to the developer, but if it's a random crash that you have no idea how it happened, I doubt I'll be able to help.

## Usage

In the main menu you should see an extra button at the bottom. It will open the Globed Menu, where you can see available Game Servers and various information about them, such as player count, region, ping, and name. All you have to do is pick the server you want and press 'Join'. After that, simply hop into a level and you will see anyone who is also playing on the level.

## Central server configuration

The default URL is http://globed.dankmeme.dev

If you want to change the URL of the Central Server, open the Globed Menu and press the gear button in bottom left. Here you can enter any valid HTTP(s) URL, and after pressing 'apply', the game will auto disconnect you from a server if you are already connected, fetch available Game Servers, and update the list. In case the list seems outdated, press the refresh button in bottom left, it will make a request to the Central Server and update the server list.

## Status

The mod is in beta and I don't have a massive motivation anymore to work on it, feel free to make changes, forks or whatever you want. I'll try to maintain it (including the servers) but can't promise
