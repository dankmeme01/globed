# Globed

Globed is an open-source, highly customizable multiplayer mod for Geometry Dash.

## Usage

In the main menu you should see an extra button at the bottom. It will open the Globed Menu, where you can see available Game Servers and various information about them, such as player count, region, ping, and name. All you have to do is pick the server you want and press 'Join'. After that, simply hop into a level and you will see anyone who is also playing on the level.

## Central server configuration

If you want to change the URL of the Central Server, open the Globed Menu and press the gear button in bottom left. Here you can enter any valid HTTP(s) URL, and after pressing 'apply', the game will auto disconnect you from a server if you are already connected, fetch available Game Servers, and update the list. In case the list seems outdated, press the refresh button in bottom left, it will make a request to the Central Server and update the server list.

## Framerate

If you want the smoothest experience, your FPS should be a multiple of the server's TPS (30 by default)

also if you see massive lags in other players' icons try to pause and unpause the game. don't ask why but it can help. i'll try my best to fix it lmao
